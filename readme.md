_Dades_ is the Catalan meaning of the English word _“data”_. It is a research project by **Victor Ndu**, that uses the application of the Big Data subject.

Currently, the scope of Dades is to create a unique identification system (UIS). The UIS can collect data from Agencies A and B, and create a means of unique identification of entities of Agencies A and B by Agencies C, D, E, …, Z.

Dades will use the QR (Quick Response) Code to to create this identification. It is a fast, secure and efficient 2D symbolic code representation. The main advantage of a QR code is its versatility. QR codes can be used for anything and everything. They are also beneficial for both customers and businesses. For example, a business saves money and advertising costs by distributing a QR code to their website or URL.  Instead of requiring a chunky hand-held scanner to scan QR Codes, many modern cell phones can scan them.

Prior to this point, QR Codes have been used for:
* Calendar Event
* Email Message
* Phone
* SMS
* Text
* URL
* meCard
* vCard v3
* Wi-fi Network Settings

Dades seeks to use the QR code technology to identify, authenticate, and validate Entities in Agencies, by other Agencies. Entities refer to people and objects; while Agencies refer to institutions, organizations, governments, companies, schools.

Below is a diagrammatic illustration of Dades:
